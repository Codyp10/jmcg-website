# Johnson Marketing & Consulting Group - Website Plans

## Current Task
**Web Development Section Visualization**

### Implementation Plan
- Create a browser mockup component showing a beautiful, modern website
- Browser chrome with realistic Chrome-style UI (address bar, navigation buttons, tabs)
- Cycle through different types of websites to show versatility:
  - E-commerce site
  - Corporate/business site
  - Portfolio/creative site
- Add subtle animations:
  - Page transitions between different site types
  - Hover effects
  - Smooth scrolling preview effect
- Show actual deliverable quality

### Mobile Optimization Requirements
**CRITICAL**: All visualizations and sections must be mobile-optimized

#### Web Dev Browser Mockup - Mobile Considerations:
- On mobile: Show single browser window (simplified/scaled down)
- On tablet: Can show browser at comfortable size
- On desktop: Full browser mockup with all details
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions
- Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- Animations perform well on mobile devices

#### General Mobile Optimization Checklist:
- [ ] All service visualizations (GEO chat, SEO search results, Web Dev browser) are responsive
- [ ] Typography scales appropriately across breakpoints
- [ ] Touch targets are minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Animations are performant on mobile (use transform/opacity)
- [ ] Images/graphics scale down gracefully
- [ ] Grid layouts adapt (4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column)
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly on mobile
- [ ] Footer is mobile-friendly
- [ ] Contact forms are thumb-friendly
- [ ] All interactive elements work with touch

#### Breakpoints to Test:
- Mobile: 320px - 640px
- Tablet: 641px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px+
